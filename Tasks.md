**Before moving to the tasks, below are some important points you have to remember before submitting the tasks**:

- You have to submit this assigmment by creating a single PR to the repository: <https://github.com/whilstsomebody/GDG-FOSS-WING-SELECTION-2025.git>, with each commit denoting a separate task. So, if there are 5 tasks then you will
have 5 separate commits in your PR.

- You should not write vague commit messages like: "Done", "completed", "initial commmit", "final commit" etc.
The commit message should indicate what it is actually doing. For example, if the commit adds my profile information,
then a suitable commit message is: "profile.md: Add profile information of whilstsomebody.".

Below is the commit format:

```sh
file_name: message.
```

- Fork and clone the repository: <https://github.com/whilstsomebody/GDG-FOSS-WING-SELECTION-2025.git>

- All the tasks have to be done in separate files inside the folder **Tasks**. You don't have to create any new file,
just edit the ones already present in the folder.

- Once you finish a task, check the checkbox corresponding to that task.

- Create a commit for the task you have just completed.

**Following are the tasks you have to complete**:

- [ ] We want to learn about you, so for that we have `profile.md`. Just add the information about you as indicated in the file.
Keep in mind, this file also works as an SOP for yourself and we will be taking a look into this one while selecting.

- [ ] Now, go to `documentation.md` and write a short documentation about any one of the open-source tools and services you
mentioned in `profile.md`. Word limit: [200-500]. 

> Note: Don't use AI.

- [ ] Finally, go to `questions.md` and answer the questions in you own words.
